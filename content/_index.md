# About Me

Welcome to my website!
I am Kartikey from Lucknow, UP.
I am pursuing my masters in Computer Science at IIT Mandi.

I enjoy programming in C++ and Python.
I am currently experimenting with Qt app development, influenced by KDE.
My posts include my experiences and ways I solve problems.

I also enjoy drawing (on paper).
It's only been around six months when I started properly learning.
I mainly focus on drawing pages from manga I read.
I don't have the ability or confidence to make original art just yet.

I also enjoy reading!
These days I've been a lot into Japanese light novels.
I also like to read about history and ideas of revolutionaries, specially from India.
Visit my book list to find out my recommendations and favourites!
